I am passionate about music and creativity, with hobbies that include playing the guitar, listening to a variety of musical genres, and drawing. These activities allow me to express myself artistically and develop discipline, patience, and attention to detail. Playing the guitar enhances my focus and coordination, while drawing enables me to think creatively and approach challenges with an open mind.
